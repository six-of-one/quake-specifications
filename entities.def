			  (default 0.1)

/*QUAKED func_frame (0 .5 .8) ? 
--------  PK  --------
Written by Matt Houser
Ripped off...err... inspired by Dimensionalitiy_s func_frame

Usage:
Required:
"targetname" "..."	- Name of group of frames, also targetname for toggling on and off
"cnt" "#"			- Frame # (1 based)
	
Optional: (* only needed on frame #1)
* "dmg" "#"		- Damage on touch (only when moving)
* "target" "..."	- Target to call on touch
* "spawnflags" "#"	- & 1: Use on touch (frame will advance on touch, and
				"target" will be triggered)
			- & 2: Stopped at start
			- & 4: Back and forth rather than looping
"wait" "#"	- Time delay between this frame and the next (default is 0.1,
				-1 should stop the animation, ignored when spawnflags & 1)
"noise" "..."	- wav to play when that frame is shown
				NOTE: if wav is too long, entire thing may not play if
				frame is shown AGAIN
"noise1" "..."	- ditto but only played when animation moving in forward direction
			- not used unless (spawnflags & 4) and noise is not set
"noise2" "..."	- ditto but only played when animation moving in backward direction
			- not used unless (spawnflags & 4) and noise is not set

- Frames are played in order starting at 1 (duplicates may be missed)
- On use, animation will start or stop
- When stopped, no damage will be done
- A wait of -1 on a frame will stop the animation there, a retrigger
	should start it up again
- "noise" is played when a frame is shown, if "noise" is not set
	and spawnflags & 4 is set, noise1 or noise2 will be played depending on current
	direction of animation
		
BUGS:
	- Slight disfiguration on some walls while moving
	- Slightly larger delay when looping back to frame #1 (gone now, not sure why)
	- Bounding box problems
	- If done properly, you can get stuck IN the animation
*/


/*QUAKED hub_teleport (0 .5 .8) ? 
--------  PK  --------

Usage:
players touch to vote for selected map identified by map key

Required:
"map"           - map name voted for must match mapname.bsp without ".bsp"
"targetname"    "votes"
                - target name MUST be votes

Option:
Use a "trigger_multiple" to identify a hub selection option
The trigger should go 64 units (or more) beyond the hub_teleport brush so
the choice can be identified before voting.

Trigger sample flags:

"message" "map identifier (mapname)"
"speed" "100"
"sounds" "4"
"wait" "4"
"lip" "0"
"dmg" "0"
"health" "0"
"delay" "0"

Message is the field that identifies the map for the associated portal

"count"
 # of players on map needed to activate teleport vote if target1 is player_count in deathmatch
 will always trigger in single player, !player_count operates in reverse
 for keeping large area maps out of polls when player count is low
 could also use a door to block off an entire area of portals - but then bots CAN still vote on them

-------- KEYS --------
message : is printed when the door is touched if it is a trigger door and it has not been fired yet

-------- NOTES --------
If two doors touch, they are assumed to be connected and operate as a unit. TOGGLE causes the door to wait in both the start and end states for a trigger event.

START_OPEN causes the door to move to its destination when spawned, and operate in reverse.
It is used to temporarily or permanently close off an area when triggered (not usefull for touch or takedamage doors).

Key doors are always wait -1.  Unless they are doom doors (have x_items bits set)

doom / q2 doors:

noise3: key fail - no default
noise4: key open - no default
map: set mode of door - "W", "D", "Q", "PK", "Q2", "Q3" - only D & Q2 are used

sound to play when train moves.

Both "noise" and "noise1" defaults
depend upon "sounds" variable and
can be overridden by the "noise"
and "noise1" variable in path_rotate.

Also in path_rotate, if STOP is set,
the train will wait until it is
retriggered before moving on to
the next goal.

Trains are moving platforms that
players can ride.

"path" specifies the first
path_rotate and is the starting
position.
If the train is the target of a
button or trigger, it will not
begin moving until activated.

The func_rotate_train entity is
the center of rotation of all
objects targeted by it.

If "deathtype" is set with a string,
this is the message that will
appear when a player is killed
by the train.

/*QUAKED func_train2 (0 .5 .8) ?
-------- HIPN --------
Hipnotic Miscellaneous Geometry
-------------------------------
This is a modification of the standard
func_train entity. It is functionally
equivalent, except that it removes a
slight delay that would occur after
each path entry, and it adds a speed
variable to the path_corner entity.

"noise" contains the name of the
sound to play when train stops.

"noise1" contains the name of the
sound to play when train moves.

Both "noise" and "noise1" defaults
depend upon "sounds" variable.

In path_corner, set speed to be
the new speed of the train after
it reaches the path change.

If speed is -1, the train will
warp directly to the next path
change after the specified wait
time.

Also in path_corner, if wait is
set to -1, the train will wait
until it is retriggered before
moving on to the next goal.

Here is a reiteration of the
func_train docs:

Trains are moving platforms
that players can ride.
The targets origin specifies
the min point of the train at
each corner. The train spawns
at the first target it is
pointing at. If the train is
the target of a button or
trigger, it will not begin
moving until activated.

/*QUAKED func_new_plat (0 .5 .8) ? DN_N_WAIT PLT_TOGGLE ELEVATOR START_AT_TOP PLAT2 P2_BOTTOM
-------- ROGU --------

DN_N_WAIT is a plat that starts at the

waits, then comes back up.

health - number of seconds to wait 
(default 5)

--------------
PLT_TOGGLE is a plat that will change 
between the top and bottom each time 
it is triggered.

--------------
ELEVATOR is an elevator plat. You can 
have as many levels as you want but 
they must be all the same distance away.
Use elevator button entity as the trigger. 

  cnt is the number of floors
  height is the distance between floors

START_AT_TOP is an optional flag for 
elevators. It just tells the elevator 
that it is position is the top floor. 
(Default is the bottom floor) USE THIS 
ONLY WITH ELEVATORS!

--------------
PLAT2 is a fixed version of the 
original plat. If you want the plat to 
start at the bottom and move to the 
top on demand, use a negative height. 
That will tell Quake to lower the plat 
at spawn time. Always place this plat 
type in the top position when making 
the map. This will ensure correct 
lighting, hopefully. If a plat2 is the 
target of a trigger, it will be 
disabled until it has been triggered. 

Delay is the wait before the plat 
returns to original position.

If you do not want to bother figuring 
out the height, do not put a value in 
the height 

delay		default 3
speed		default 150
cnt		default 2

P2_BOTTOM is an optional switch to 
have an auto-sized plat2 start at the 
bottom.
--------------
Plats are always drawn in the extended 
position, so they will light correctly.

If the plat is the target of another 
trigger or button, it will start out 
disabled in the extended position 
until it is trigger, when it will 
lower and become a normal plat.

If the "height" key is set, that will 
determine the amount the plat moves, 
instead of being implicitly determined 
by the model_s height.

Set "sounds" to one of the following:
1) base fast
2) chain slow

of 12 markers per track. 
This is vital for the position
calculation code to work 
accurately. If a player 
destroys their vehicle,
they will respawn at the last
marker touched, and will be
facing the direction specified
by the marker.

Each marker is given an index 
number. This enables the code
to detect whether the markers
have been activated in sequence.
Index numbers start from 1.

-------- NOTES --------
When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a maximum angle deviation from the normal trajectory formed by a straight line between the shooter and the aiming entity it targets. The final trajectory will be a random value anywhere between no deviation at all (0) to maximum deviation (value of the random key).

Both the setting "angles" key or "targeting a target_position" methods can be used to aim the shooter. However, the target_position method is simpler.*/

/*QUAKED target_delay (0 .7 .7) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
Time delay trigger intermediary. Like a target_relay, this can only be fired by other triggers which will cause it in turn to fire its own targets.
--------  Q3  --------
-------- KEYS --------
targetname : activating trigger points to this.

Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
--------  Q3  --------
-------- KEYS --------
noise : path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).

volume: value 0.1 - 1.0 for volume level of sound - default = 1.0

LOOPED_OFF : sound will loop and initially start off in level --- (will toggle on/off when triggered). NO
GLOBAL : sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR : sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model_s sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/

So if one of the items in the team has it is "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

/*QUAKED func_door_rotating (0 .5 .8) ? START_OPEN REVERSE CRUSHER NOMONSTER ANIMATED TOGGLE X_AXIS Y_AXIS
--------  Q2  --------
TOGGLE causes the door to wait in both the start and end states for a trigger event.

START_OPEN	the door to moves to its destination when spawned, and operate in reverse.  It is used to temporarily or permanently close off an area when triggered (not useful for touch or takedamage doors).
NOMONSTER	monsters will not trigger this door

You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity.  The center of that brush will be
the point around which it is rotated. It will rotate around the Z axis by default.  You can
check either the X_AXIS or Y_AXIS box to change that.

"distance" is how many degrees the door will be rotated.
"speed" determines how fast the door moves; default value is 100.

REVERSE will cause the door to rotate in the opposite direction.

"message"	is printed when the door is touched if it is a trigger door and it has not been fired yet
"angle"		determines the opening direction
"targetname" if set, no touch field will be spawned and a remote button or trigger field activates the door.
"health"	if set, door must be shot open
"speed"		movement speed (100 default)
"wait"		wait before returning (3 default, -1 = never return)

func_water is a moveable water brush.  It must be targeted to operate.  Use a non-water texture at your own risk.

"speed"		movement speed (25 default)
"wait"		wait before returning (-1 default, -1 = TOGGLE)
